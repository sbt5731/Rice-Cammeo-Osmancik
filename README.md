Data Set Information:

Among the certified rice grown in TURKEY, the Osmancik species, which has a large planting area since 1997 and the Cammeo species grown since 2014 have been selected for the study. When looking at the general characteristics of Osmancik species, they have a wide, long, glassy and dull appearance. When looking at the general characteristics of the Cammeo species, they have wide and long, glassy and dull in appearance. A total of 3810 rice grain's images were taken for the two species, processed and feature inferences were made. 7 morphological features were obtained for each grain of rice.


Attribute Information:

1.) Area: Returns the number of pixels within the boundaries of the rice grain.
2.) Perimeter: Calculates the circumference by calculating the distance between pixels around the boundaries of the rice grain.
3.) Major Axis Length: The longest line that can be drawn on the rice grain, i.e. the main axis distance, gives.
4.) Minor Axis Length: The shortest line that can be drawn on the rice grain, i.e. the small axis distance, gives.
5.) Eccentricity: It measures how round the ellipse, which has the same moments as the rice grain, is.
6.) Convex Area: Returns the pixel count of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the rice grain.
7.) Extent: Returns the ratio of the regionformed by the rice grain to the bounding box pixels.
8.) Class: Cammeo and Osmancik rices
